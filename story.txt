Jacob Brevard: I left my house and I ran to the grocery store. There I looked for something to eat. I was really hungry so I bought $500 in groceries.

Ruizhe Wang: The I found someone followed me. "He must be a thief," I thought, "he wants my goods." So I started to walk faster, and even faster, and then I started to run.

Jacob Brevard: I was really scared so I ran into the arcade. There I found a toy blaster and hoped that it would scare away my pursuer. I prayed that I would make it out of this horrible nightmare. I ran outside the arcade and starting yelling to hopefully intimidate the attacker. Then I saw a beautiful star in the sky.

Evan: And I remembered the ephemeral nature of life.  As I thought about the fact that the light that I'm seeing is from a star that has likely long since died, I felt small, almost meaningless in this vast expanse that we call the universe.  It's ineffible the comfort I felt from this revelation.

Charlie: The groceries were no longer a concern of mine. The thief can have them if he wants. I have unlocked a deeper meaning to life, much beyond that of material goods. After allowing my goods to be stolen, I moved to Austria and became a monk in the alps. How that single day at the grocery store changed my lifeforever.

Evan:  And everyone lived happily ever after.

The end.
