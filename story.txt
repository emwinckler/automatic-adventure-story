Ruizhe Wang: The I found someone followed me. "He must be a thief," I thought, "he wants my goods." So I started to walk faster, and even faster, and then I started to run.

Jacob Brevard: I was really scared so I ran into the arcade. There I found a toy blaster and hoped that it would scare away my pursuer. I prayed that I would make it out of this horrible nightmare. I ran outside the arcade and starting yelling to hopefully intimidate the attacker. Then I saw a beautiful star in the sky.
